AI PROJECT - Virtual Assistant - Written in Python

ABSTRACT OF PROJECT
This project is “VIRTUAL VOICE ASSISTANT”. The main aim of this project is to create a responsive virtual assistant to perform basic operations based on oral commands of user. It can perform operations based on oral instructions given by the user. It performs operations like opening applications, displaying date and time, browsing information, greetings etc. This project is more effective because of its simple and responsive GUI (Graphical User Interface). As virtual assistance is a playing a vital role in every sector like virtual help in business, health etc. There is a lot of scope for this project in the present generation AI. As everything is getting automated these days people are showing enormous interest towards the applications that are working for them like chatbots, voice assistants , which are easy to work on. Examples of these trending application is Google Assistant, Siri for iPhone, Amazon Alexa, Cortana in windows etc., So, it has lot of future scope to learn and to expand its application.

LIBRARIES USED
Gtts (Google text to speech)
This library is used to convert the text to audio. It is useful in production of voice for the assistant according to the user instruction.

speech_recognition
This Library for performing speech recognition, with support for several engines and APIs, online and offline.

playsound
This library is used to play the sound of converted text uskking Gtts. It is a Pure Python, cross platform, single function module with no dependencies for playing sounds.

Calendar
This library was used for fetching date and time.

Wikipedia
This library is used for fetching the information of persons, places, topics according to user command.

os and subprocess
These libraries are used to open the desktop applications on the system like excel, word etc.

threading
This library is used to create a timer between the user command and virtual assistant response.

warning
This library was used to warn the system for malfunctioning in the code. Warning messages are typically issued in situations where it is useful to alert the user of some condition in a program, where that condition (normally) doesn’t warrant raising an exception and terminating the program.

Tkinter
This library was used to create GUI for the Virtual Assistant. This project also used webbrowser library to search for user requirements.
